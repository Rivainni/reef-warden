[ACTION=BG] Oh no.
[ACTION=EnterCharacterPaulo]Concerned: Whoa, why are you guys packing your stuff?
[NAME=Diana]Angry: Don’t you remember what happens when we don’t do our jobs?
[ACTION=EnterCharacterJulio]Concerned: Based on the reports we had to send to Office about the reef’s condition, they said that we had to be replaced by another team.
Since we weren’t doing our jobs well enough to maintain the reef’s condition
[NAME=Diana]So, we’re fired, we’ll get our last paychecks and our benefits as soon as we return to the mainland and that’s it. We go our separate ways, bye bye to the team.
[ACTION=EnterCharacterCarla]We couldn’t do our jobs properly, so there’s no reason for them to keep us
