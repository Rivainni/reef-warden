[ACTION=BG]Oh no.
[ACTION=EnterCharacterPaulo]Concerned:Whoa, why are you guys packing your stuff?
[NAME=Diana]Angry:Don’t you remember what happens when we don’t do our jobs?
[ACTION=EnterCharacterJulio]Concerned: Based on the reports we had to send to the Tubbataha Management Office about the reef’s condition, they said that we had to be replaced by another team.
Angry:The whole Tubbataha Protected Area Management Board said it themselves-
Angry:Since we weren’t doing our jobs well enough to maintain the reef’s condition...
[NAME=Diana]Angry:We’re fired. We’ll get our last paychecks and our benefits as soon as we return to the mainland and that’s it. We go our separate ways, bye bye to the team.
[ACTION=EnterCharacterCarla]Angry:We couldn’t do our jobs properly, so there’s no reason for them to keep us.
