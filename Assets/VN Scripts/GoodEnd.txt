[ACTION=BG] You return to the ranger station.
[ACTION=EnterCharacterJulio]Idle: Guys!! We got it, our research quota!! We have to appoint a meeting immediately to the management office so that we can request the extra funding they told us.
[NAME=Diana]Happy: YESS!!
[ACTION=EnterCharacterJulia]Happy2: Money!? I heard the magical words of society and I say YES!!
[ACTION=EnterCharacterCarla]Idle: So does this mean we’re actually going to have money for a proper PC? I’m excited for that.
[ACTION=EnterCharacterPaulo]Happy: Nice!
[ACTION=EnterCharacterManuel]Idle: As long as it’ll let me do less work.
Idle: Can we also ask for new equipment now? Also for more people to help with the station rather than just me keeping it together with duct tape and glue?
[ACTION=EnterCharacterJulio]Idle: Well it still depends on how the meeting will go, but I’m confident they’ll let us have those due to the hard work we’ve done for the reef.
